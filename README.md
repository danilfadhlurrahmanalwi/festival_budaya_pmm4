#### Project Description 
As a Human Resources staff for the Medical Division, I was responsible for coordinating activities and ensuring the smooth operation of the team. I successfully selected 10 participants to represent the division in the Pesta Mahasiswa Nusantara event, taking into account the team's qualifications. In addition, I also created and managed a four-week training and meeting schedule to support the development of the Medical Division members. In carrying out this role, I prioritized clear and effective communication between the management and members of the division to build trust and good collaboration. One of the challenges I faced was adjusting the availability of all members to the training schedule that had been designed. I overcame this challenge through open discussions, adjusting the implementation time, and making flexible arrangements so that all members could participate. This experience honed my ability to solve problems, adapt, and manage teamwork effectively.
